Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a memory B cell tropic virus, has been identified as necessary but not sufficient for development of MS. The molecular and immunological basis for this has not been established. Infected B cell proliferation is driven by signalling through the EBV produced cell surface protein LMP1, a homologue of the MS risk gene CD40. METHODS: We have investigated transcriptomes of B cells and EBV-infected B cells at Latency III (LCLs) and identified MS risk genes with altered expression on infection and with expression levels associated with the MS risk genotype (LCLeQTLs). The association of LCLeQTL genomic burden with EBV phenotypes in vitro and in vivo was examined. The risk genotype effect on LCL proliferation with CD40 stimulation was assessed. RESULTS: These LCLeQTL MS risk SNP:gene pairs (47 identified) were over-represented in genes dysregulated between B and LCLs (p < 1.53 x 10(-4)), and as target loci of the EBV transcription factor EBNA2 (p < 3.17 x 10(-16)). Overall genetic burden of LCLeQTLs was associated with some EBV phenotypes but not others. Stimulation of the CD40 pathway by CD40L reduced LCL proliferation (p < 0.001), dependent on CD40 and TRAF3 MS risk genotypes. Both CD40 and TRAF3 risk SNPs are in binding sites for the EBV transcription factor EBNA2, with expression of each correlated with EBNA2 expression dependent on genotype. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate targeting EBV may be of therapeutic benefit in MS.                                 |                                                                Afrasiabi A;Parnell GP;Fewings N;Schibeci SD;Basuki MA;Chandramohan R;Zhou Y;Taylor B;Brown DA;Swaminathan S;McKay FC;Stewart GJ;Booth DR;                                |                                                                PMID:31039804

In one of the largest GWAS, more than 200 risk loci have been identified for Multiple Sclerosis (MS) susceptibility. Infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) appears to be necessary for the development of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Many MS risk loci are associated with altered gene expression in EBV infected B cells (LCLs). We have interrogated this immunological context to identify interaction between MS risk loci and EBV DNA copy number, intrinsic growth rate and EBV encoded miRNA expression. The EBV DNA  copy number was associated with significantly more risk alleles for MS than for other diseases or traits. EBV miRNAs BART4-3p and BART3-5p were highly associated with EBV DNA copy number and MS risk loci. The poliovirus receptor (PVR) risk SNP was associated with EBV DNA copy number, PVR and miRNA expression. Targeting EBV  miRNAs BART4-3p and BART3-5p, and the gene PVR, may provide therapeutic benefit in MS. This study also indicates how immunological context and risk loci interactions can be exploited to validate and develop novel therapeutic approaches.                             |                                                        Afrasiabi A;Parnell GP;Swaminathan S;Stewart GJ;Booth DR;                            |                                                        PMID:31932685

More than  200 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are known to be associated with the risk of developing MS. About a quarter of these are also highly associated with proximal gene expression in B cells infected with EBV (lymphoblastoid cell lines-LCLs). The DNA of LCLs is hypomethylated compared with both uninfected and  activated B cells. Since methylation can affect gene expression, and so cell differentiation and immune evasion, we hypothesised that EBV-driven hypomethylation may affect the interaction between EBV infection and MS. We interrogated an existing dataset comprising three individuals with whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data from EBV transformed B cells and CD40L-activated B cells. DNA methylation surrounding MS risk SNPs associated with gene expression in LCLs (LCLeQTL) was less likely to be hypomethylated than randomly selected chromosomal regions. Differential methylation was independent of genomic features such as promoter regions, but genes preferentially expressed in EBV-infected B cells, including the LCLeQTL genes, were underrepresented in the hypomethylated regions. Our data does not indicate MS genetic risk is affected by EBV hypomethylation.                         |                                                Ong LTC;Parnell GP;Afrasiabi A;Stewart GJ;Swaminathan S;Booth DR;                        |                                                PMID:31619767

In the current COVID-19 global pandemic, there is a lack of reliable clinical tools to assist clinicians to perform accurate triage. Host response biomarkers have recently shown promise in risk stratification of disease progression; however, the role of these biomarkers in predicting disease progression in patients with COVID-19 is unknown. Here, we present a protocol outlining a prospective validation study to  evaluate the biomarkers' performance in predicting clinical outcomes of patients  with COVID-19. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This prospective validation study assesses patients infected with COVID-19, in whom blood samples are prospectively collected. Recruited patients include a range of infection severity from asymptomatic to critically ill patients, recruited from the community, outpatient clinics, emergency departments and hospitals. Study samples consist of peripheral blood samples collected into RNA-preserving (PAXgene/Tempus) tubes on patient presentation or immediately on study enrolment. Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) will be performed on total RNA extracted from collected blood samples using primers specific to host response gene expression biomarkers that have been previously identified in studies of respiratory viral infections. The RT-PCR data will be analysed to assess the diagnostic performance of individual biomarkers in predicting COVID-19-related outcomes, such as viral pneumonia, acute respiratory  distress syndrome or bacterial pneumonia. Biomarker performance will be evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, likelihood ratios and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This research protocol aims to study the host response  gene expression biomarkers in severe respiratory viral infections with a pandemic potential (COVID-19). It has been approved by the local ethics committee with approval number 2020/ETH00886. The results of this project will be disseminated in international peer-reviewed scientific journals. commercial re-use. See rights and permissions.

LID - 2927 [pii] LID - 10.3390/ijms22062927 [doi] AB  - Although the causes of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) still remain largely unknown, multiple lines of evidence suggest that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection may contribute to the development of MS. Here, we aimed to identify the potential contribution of EBV-encoded and host cellular miRNAs to MS pathogenesis. We identified differentially expressed host miRNAs in EBV infected B cells (LCLs) and putative host/EBV miRNA interactions with MS risk loci. We estimated the genotype effect of MS risk loci on the identified putative miRNA:mRNA interactions in silico. We found that the protective allele of MS risk SNP rs4808760 reduces the expression of hsa-mir-3188-3p. In addition, our analysis suggests that hsa-let-7b-5p may interact with ZC3HAV1 differently in LCLs compared to B cells. In vitro assays indicated that the protective allele of MS risk SNP rs10271373 increases ZC3HAV1 expression in LCLs, but not in B cells. The higher expression for the protective allele in LCLs is consistent with increased  IFN response via ZC3HAV1 and so decreased immune evasion by EBV. Taken together,  this provides evidence that EBV infection dysregulates the B cell miRNA machinery, including MS risk miRNAs, which may contribute to MS pathogenesis via  interaction with MS risk genes either directly or indirectly.

Earlier we had identified six MS risk loci that are co-located with binding sites for the EBV transcription factor Epstein-Barr Nuclear Antigen 2 (EBNA2) in EBV-infected B cells (lymphoblastoid cell lines - LCLs). METHODS: We used an allele-specific chromatin immunoprecipitation PCR assay to assess EBNA2 allelic preference. We treated LCLs with a peptide inhibitor of EBNA2 (EBNA2-TAT), reasoning that inhibiting EBNA2 function would alter gene expression at these loci if it was mediated by EBNA2. FINDINGS: We found that EBNA2 binding was dependent on the risk allele for five of these six MS risk loci (p < 0.05). Treatment with EBNA2-TAT significantly altered the expression of TRAF3 (p < 0.05), CD40 (p < 0.001), CLECL1 (p <0.0001), TNFAIP8 (p < 0.001) and TNFRSF1A (p < 0.001). INTERPRETATION: These data suggest  that EBNA2 can enhance or reduce expression of the gene depending on the risk allele, likely promoting EBV infection. This is consistent with the concept that  these MS risk loci affect MS risk through altering the response to EBNA2. Together with the extensive data indicating a pathogenic role for EBV in MS, this study supports targeting EBV and EBNA2 to reduce their effect on MS pathogenesis.

Treatment is based on immunomodulation, including specifically targeting B cells. B cells are the main host for the Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), which has been described as necessary for MS development. Over 200 genetic loci have been identified as increasing susceptibility to MS. Many MS risk genes have  altered expression in EBV infected B cells, dependent on the risk genotype, and are themselves regulated by the EBV transcription factor EBNA2. Females are 2-3 times more likely to develop MS than males. We investigated if MS risk loci might mediate the gender imbalance in MS. From a large public dataset, we identified gender-specific associations with EBV traits, and MS risk SNP/gene pairs with gender differences in their associations with gene expression. Some of these genes also showed gender differences in correlation of gene expression level with Estrogen Receptor 2. To test if estrogens may drive these gender specific differences, we cultured EBV infected B cells (lymphoblastoid cell lines, LCLs),  in medium depleted of serum to remove the effects of sex hormones as well as the  estrogenic effect of phenol red, and then supplemented with estrogen (100 nM estradiol). Estradiol treatment altered MS risk gene expression, LCL proliferation rate, EBV DNA copy number and EBNA2 expression in a sex-dependent manner. Together, these data indicate that there are estrogen-mediated gender-specific differences in MS risk gene expression and EBV functions. This may in turn contribute to gender differences in host response to EBV and to MS susceptibility.

This enzyme has recently been shown to be capable of restricting SARS-CoV-2. These data have led to the hypothesis that the low abundance of CpG in the SARS-CoV-2 genome is due to an evolutionary pressure exerted by the host ZAP. To investigate this hypothesis, we performed a detailed analysis of many coronavirus sequences and ZAP RNA binding preference data. Our analyses showed neither evidence for an evolutionary pressure acting specifically on CpG dinucleotides, nor a link between the activity of ZAP and the low CpG abundance of the SARS-CoV-2 genome.     |        Afrasiabi A;Alinejad-Rokny H;Khosh A;Rahnama M;Lovell N;Xu Z;Ebrahimi D;    |        PMID:35165300
